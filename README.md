# itchCleanScreen
a tiny firefox extension to hide the overlays on itch.io game pages

## How To Use
Download [the .xpi file](https://github.com/nextlevelbanana/itchCleanScreen/blob/main/itchcleanscreen-1.0.0-fx.xpi) from this repo; open it with Firefox and the browser should prompt you to install it. 

That's it! Now you should be able to view and play games on itch.io without all the little overlay links. 

Want the links back? Just disable the extension in your addons menu (type "about:addons" into the url bar).
